        <p><b><i>Iceland</i></b> is a country of sharp contrasts.
          A place where fire and ice coexist. Where dark winters are offset
          by the summer's midnight sun. A country where insular existance has
          spurred a rich and vibrant culture.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="p1c">
        <p> The Aurora Borealis takes its name from the Roman goddess
        of dawn, Aurora, and the Greek name for the north wind, Boreas.
        From September to April, Iceland is a hotspot for this magificient
        lightshow.</p>
        <p>The Aurora Borealis, more commonly referred as the Northern Lights is
          a natural phenomenon created when particles emitted by the sun interact
          with the atmosphere in the Earth's magnetic field. This releases energy,
          causing peculiar luminous green streaks acress the skies.</p>

        <div class="p1c">
          <p>When making a trip to Iceland, it is hard to not pay special attention
            to the country's namesake-namely, its 4,500 square miles of glacier.
            Ice climbing on the glaciers is practiced year-round and takes mainly
            on the Sólheimajökull and Svínafellsjökull glaciers in the south of Iceland,
            to which day trips are offered from Reykjavik(and Skaftafell).</p>
